index_mgrs.py uses GDAL's Python bindings and Howard Butler's mgrs library to
read the EXIF tags from a Nikon D90 JPEG image, and spits out a simple JSON
dict into index.json in the same directory that maps filename to a dict
containing {'lat', 'lon', 'mgrs'}.

Yes, I know this is written in Python and the rest of the project is in Ruby.
